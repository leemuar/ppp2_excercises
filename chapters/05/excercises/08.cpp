Write a program that reads and stores a series of integers and then com-
putes the sum of the first N integers. First ask for N, then read the values
into a vector, then calculate the sum of the first N values.
Handle all inputs. for example, make sure to give an error message if the
user asks for a sum of more numbers than there are in the vector
