##Chapter 13

### Exercise 13

randint() generates the same number sequence no matter what seed you set 
with srand()
srand() does not affect randint(), it is probably a mistake brought to 
the exercise text from previous edition of the book. I had to write my 
own function for rng using C's rand() to get this exercise done.
